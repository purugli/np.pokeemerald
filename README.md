# Nostalgia Proof Pok√©mon Emerald

This is a true to spirit Romhack of Pokemon Emerald designed to refresh and update the game without modernizing it too much.
Our goal is to improve the difficulty curve, viability of most pokemon lines, and quality of life using primarily tools
that were in the original toolbox of the game.

To set up the repository and build the ROM, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).


Acknowledgements:

None of this would be possible without the pret disassembly team: [pret.github.io](https://pret.github.io/).

Trainer control improvements were imported from the Emerald Expansion project ( https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion )
and combined with some custom Battle Frontier improvements from ShinyDragonHunter ( https://github.com/ShinyDragonHunter )  these
improvements can be found isolated as a feature branch under "trainercontrol" in this repo.

For questions, suggestions and playtest information you can contact the developer at purugli.np@gmail.com

Thank you and I hope you enjoy the project!
