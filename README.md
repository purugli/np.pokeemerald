# Trainer Control for vanilla Pokeemerald

This is a feature branch for vanilla pokeemerald that includes trainer control features and Battle Frontier updates
that allow you to interact with frontier trainers the same way you would regular trainers.

The trainer control features are from the Emerald Expansion (https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion)
while the BF changes were put together by ShinyDragonHunter (https://github.com/ShinyDragonHunter)
